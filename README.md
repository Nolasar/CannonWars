# CannonWars

**CannonWars** is an arcade-style mobile game where players defend against incoming projectiles by matching them to the correct boxes. Cannons shoot various types of projectiles toward the bottom center of the screen, where several static boxes are positioned. Each projectile corresponds to a specific box. The player gains points for matching projectiles to the correct box and loses lives for mismatches. The goal is to score as many points as possible while maintaining lives.

## Gameplay Overview
- **Objective**: Score by correctly matching the projectile type to its associated box.
- **Lives System**: The player loses one life per mismatch. Game over occurs when all lives are lost.
- **Score System**: Points are awarded for correct matches. The game tracks high scores.
